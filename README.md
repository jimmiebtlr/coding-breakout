Time taken ~ 3.5 hours.  I'll refund the amount over 1 hour.

There is quite a few things needed for a true quality implementation of the given task, this repository is a subset.


Present
- Cloudinary for uploads.  Allows easy responsive sizes and quite a bit more.
  - This works through slingshot.  I'm the author of the cloudinary integration for slingshot
    Slingshot works by securly upload directly from the client, meaning less bandwidth needed on your server
- Sort by and sort Direction
  - This is implemented as a url param, meaning a user can share search results
- Includes basic seed data
- Includes new product form


Future
- Server side rendering
- SEO 
- Responsive image sizes - Cloudinary is the first step for this
- Grid items should be fixed height
- Images should be full width
